\BOOKMARK [3][-]{subsubsection.5.3.3}{Are there any newsgroups that the algorithm confuses more often than others? Why do you think this is?}{subsection.5.3}% 19
\BOOKMARK [3][-]{subsubsection.5.3.4}{Retrain your Naive Bayes classifier for values of beta between 0.00001 and 1 and report the accuracy over the test set for each value of B. Create a plot with values of beta on the x-axis and accuracy on the y-axis. Use a logarithmic scale for the x-axis. Explain in a few sentences why accuracy drops for both small and large values of beta.}{subsection.5.3}% 20
\BOOKMARK [3][-]{subsubsection.5.3.5}{Propose a method for ranking the words in the dataset based on how much the classifier 'relies on' them when performing its classification. It should give high schores to those words that appear frequently in one or a few of the newsgroups but not in other ones. Words that are used frequently in general English should have lower scores, as well as words that only appear extremely rarely throughout the whole dataset.}{subsection.5.3}% 21
\BOOKMARK [3][-]{subsubsection.5.3.6}{Implement your method, set beta back to 1/|V| and print out the 100 words with the highest measure.}{subsection.5.3}% 22
\BOOKMARK [3][-]{subsubsection.5.3.7}{If the points in the training dataset were not sampled independently at random from the same distribution of data we plan to classify in the future, we might call that training set biased. Dataset bias is a problem because the performance of a classifier on a biased dataset will not accurately reflect its future performance in the real world. Look again at the words your classifier is 'relying on'. Do you see any signs of dataset bias?}{subsection.5.3}% 23
